# STEPS TO UPLOAD SH!T for the first time
# 
#  1. Call the generateIDmeta method to UPLOAD THE FOLDERS and create the DICTIONARY to with all the FOLDER NAMES and their ID.
#   
#  2. Create a FILE which has the FOLDER PATHS and their IDs by calling the method createMetaFiles().
#
#  3. Now you have the FOLDER IDs, you can upload the FILES to drive by calling the putFiles() method.
#
#  4. Create a FILE which has all the FILE PATHS and their IDs by calling the method createMetaFiles().
#
# 5. Now, you just have to integrate the newly created FILE and FOLDER IDs to the existing files
#

# STEPS TO UPLOAD SH!T not for the first time
# 
#  USE THE readFolderId() to get the dictionary of the FOLDER PATHS and their IDs.  
#
#  CREATING NEW FOLDERS
#   1. Call the generateIDmeta() method without the FIRSTTIME arg as false or ignore it.
#   2. The above step will also add to the dictionary
#
#  CREATING NEW FILES
#   1. Call the putFiles() method 
#   2. This will also add to the dictionary
